# The Cost of Scrolling

A small product thinking project exploring how time spent browsing in food delivery apps can function as a hidden user cost rather than a sign of engagement.

## Why this project

Food delivery is often a low-energy, time-sensitive decision.
Users open the app hungry, tired, or distracted — not looking to explore endlessly.

This project looks at a simple question:

**At what point does scrolling stop helping users decide and start making the experience worse?**

Rather than building features, this project focuses on:
- user behaviour under cognitive load
- decision fatigue and choice overload
- product trade-offs at scale

## What this is (and isn’t)

**This is:**
- A PM-style problem exploration
- Grounded in public datasets and behavioural research
- Focused on judgement, not implementation

**This is not:**
- A redesign
- A dashboard
- A feature proposal for any specific company
- An analysis of proprietary data

## Data approach

Insights are informed by:
- Public e-commerce session datasets (e.g. Google Analytics sample data)
- UK digital behaviour and screen-time studies
- Behavioural economics research on choice overload

These are used as **proxies** to reason about food delivery contexts.

## Structure

1. Problem framing: why scrolling deserves scrutiny  
2. User states: when browsing becomes effort  
3. Data & evidence: what public data suggests  
4. Trade-offs & assumptions: what we accept and why  
5. Experiment thinking: how this could be tested safely  
6. Reflection: what I would explore next

## Timeframe

This project was developed iteratively over several weeks to mirror how a PM might explore a small but high-impact problem before committing to solutions.
